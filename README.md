# Deploying Distributed Fabrics with Aruba NetConductor
## Introduction
:wave: **Welcome to the Deploying Distributed Fabrics TSS lab.**
* In this lab you will use Aruba NetConductor to build and configure your own network fabric running EVPN-VXLAN for reachability and micro-segmentation. Then put the configuration to the test with the new Central 'Global Roles' functionality.
* You have access to dedicated hardware running in our 'workbench' facility, and your own, tailor-made, Aruba Central account.
* Plus there is a Windows Active Directory Domain and ClearPass up and running to enable you to test user 802.1X AuthN and role assignment.
* Don't worry if this is your first time with Aruba Central or EVPN-VXLAN - this guide will step you through the process.

### Lab Setup
Ok so what toys do you have to play with then?
1. A dedicated spine and leaf network comprised of:
    * 2 x 8325
    * 2 x 6300
2. An Aruba Central Account
3. 2 x Wins 10 clients - to emulate user login/802.1X
   
All of the above is dedicated to your own lab 'pod'.
There is also a shared ClearPass instance and a Windows 2019 server running Active Directory. These have already been configured for you and are shared amongst the whole lab so:

**Please do not reconfigure the CPPM or Windows 2019 server - everyone needs to share those resources.**
